```bash
# clone it
git clone https://github.com/nw8g/dead-av.git && cd dead-av

# build
make

# place BdApiUtil64.sys next to avk.exe
# run as admin

## what it kills

kills 100+ security processes continuously:

* Windows Defender (msmpeng, smartscreen, etc)
* CrowdStrike Falcon variants
* SentinelOne agents
* Carbon Black
* Symantec/Norton/McAfee
* Malwarebytes/Kaspersky/Bitdefender
* Analysis tools
* EDR/SIEM agents (Elastic, Splunk, Tanium, etc)

basically‚Ä¶ if it moves and smells like protection, it kills it

---

## how it works

1. loads `BdApiUtil64.sys` as a Windows service
2. scans processes every 2‚Äì3 seconds
3. kills targets from kernel space via ioctl `0x800024B4`
4. runs forever until you hit `ctrl+c`
